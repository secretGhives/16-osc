	      <p>OSC is a consulting company based in Costa Rica, specializing in creating solutions based on Open Source software. We believe in the power of Open Source to provide solutions that are simultaneously cost-effective, useful, and empowering. Open Source is a rising tide in the global economy, and many companies that had not heard of Open Source 3 years ago today have already made the jump, or are seriously considering it. We know that anyone thinking about making the move to Open Source software will have lots of questions, and will encounter problems at some point. We are here to help provide you with answers and solutions.</p>

	      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
	      <p>Our company is founded on a philosophy. Here we share it with you.
	The OSC Mission
	To provide software development expertise and aid clients using or transitioning to Open Source software.
	
	To develop, promote and expand Open Source and Free Software expertise within Costa Rica.
	Free Software
	According to the Free Software Foundation:
	
	Free software is a matter of the users' freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. More precisely, it refers to four kinds of freedom, for the users of the software:
	
	The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).
	The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
	The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).
	The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits (freedom 3). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
	These are the bare essentials. {{text}}We encourage you to read the full definition of Free Software to fully grasp its import.
	
	Most users of computer software today have only ever used proprietary software, and do not realize the many advantages that are intrinsic to Free Software.
	
	Applying Free Software Practically
	Individuals, companies, and governments around the world are learning that these freedoms bring other advantages to projects written and distributed as Free Software.
	
	Anyone can review the source code, so Free Software tends to have higher quality and fewer security problems than proprietary software.
	Anyone can contribute to the code, or pay someone else to. Free Software projects can be customized for your particular needs.
	The software can be shared by everyone. A given solution only has to be coded once, not repeated by lots of different companies.
	The cost of Free Software is usually $0, or maybe a small fee for the distribution media.
	Free Software is often developed by people from around the world, and tends to be less U.S. centric than proprietary software.
	Free software is a good thing primarily because of the freedoms it gives the user, especially the freedoms to make changes and to share those changes with others. Many people have begun emphasizing the practical aspects of the particular freedom to view and modify the source code. Thus, you will also hear the term "Open Source" used. Those who care more about the freedom prefer "Free Software". Those who care more about the practical advantages prefer "Open Source". Either is preferable to proprietary, or closed source software. At OSC, we are happy to provide our clients with service and support for either type of software.
	
	Did you know that...
	
	The majority of web servers on the internet use the Free Software product Apache?
	Several Open Source databases are available that compete feature-wise with offerings from Microsoft, IBM, and Oracle?
	On a single CD, you can obtain a Free Software operating system, Office Suite, Web Browser and Server, Databases, Programming languages, Games, and tons more, free of cost?
	Big companies like IBM, Sun, and HP are creating Free Software products and offering support and installation services?
	Governments around the world are installing and mandating the use of Open Source software in public institutions?</p>
